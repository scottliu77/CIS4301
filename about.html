<p>This website is our group project for CIS 4301: Information and Database Systems. Our application allows users to search League of Legends players and retrieve statistics about their gameplay. Our website will provide three main functionalities: Player Search, Leaderboard, and Champion Search.</p>

<p>Users may use the Player Search feature to view statistics about their individual gameplay. Data that may be obtained include the player's division and tier, total kills, total deaths, total assists, total games (and how many of them a player has won and lost), top five mastered champions (and their respective statistics), and more. Averages for these statistics are also provided. </p>

<p>Users may use the Leaderboard function to see which players are the best with a given specified champion. Players may choose to filter how many players are displayed in the result page, how the players in the result table are sorted, which divisions the players are chosen from, as well as which regions the players are chosen from. The players that are populated in the table are those players which have the champion as one of their top five mastered champions.</p>

<p>Users may also use the champions search function to view the statistics about a given champion used among all players in the database or compare the statistics between two champions. Data includes how many players have that champion in their top 5 mastered champs, average KDA, average win rate, and more. You may also search for two champions at once, giving useful summaries on the advantages of each champion.</p>
